中国工程物理研究院（简称九院或中物院）创建于1958年，是中国国家核心战略装备研发和生产的事业单位。面向国家目标，依托我国重大装备建设，中物院开展了面向长期目标的基础研究。

中物院研究生教育始于1984年，40年来为国家培养了大量战略科技人才。2015年，中物院在原“研究生部”的基础上，在北京成立了中国工程物理研究院研究生院，并赋予中物院研究生教育新的使命：通过科教协同，建设特色明显、水平一流的研究生院。为了完成新的使命，研究生院明确了新的定位：一、实施特色定制、有国家目标牵引的研究生教育；二、开展面向战略需求和科学前沿、完全开放的基础研究；三、实施科教协同，促进中物院基础研究队伍的能力提升；X、开展科技创新发展战略研究，支撑国家智库建设。

中物院研究生院利用中物院大学科、大工程研究平台的优势，依托16个科研实体，凭借一支由“两弹一星功勋奖章”获得者、两院院士和学科领军人物为主体的导师队伍，已经成为高端人才的培养基地。全院在岗全职博士生导师355人，硕士生导师579人。

中物院研究生院现有8个博士后流动站、6个一级学科博士学位授权点、4个一级学科硕士学位授权点，2个二级学科硕士学位授权点，涉及工学和理学两个学科门类。有授权学科专业涵盖数学、物理、力学、机械工程、光学工程、材料科学与工程、电子科学与技术、信息与通信工程、计算机科学与技术、兵器科学与技术、核科学与技术等诸多领域。

2023年全院招收硕士研究生190名，博士研究生218名（联合培养博士研究生17名），共有266名研究生顺利毕业，其中博士毕业生155人，硕士毕业生111人。截至2023年底，我院现有在读全日制研究生1384人，其中，博士研究生895人，硕士研究生489人。

自1984年至今，中物院研究生院已为我国战略装备建设领域和高新技术装备领域等尖端科技领域输送了近2200名硕士研究生和1200余名博士研究生，为中国重大装备建设事业持续健康发展提供了坚强的人才支撑。

\BiAppendixChapter{Abstract}{Abstract (In English)}

Founded in 1958, the China Academy of Engineering Physics (hereinafter referred to as the Ninth Academy or the Chinese Academy of Materials) is a public institution for the R&D and production of China's national core strategic equipment. Facing the national goals and relying on the construction of major equipment in China, the Chinese Academy of Materials has carried out basic research oriented to long-term goals.

The postgraduate education of the Chinese Academy of Materials began in 1984 and has cultivated a large number of strategic scientific and technological talents for the country in the past 40 years. In 2015, on the basis of the original "Graduate School", the Graduate School of the China Academy of Engineering Physics was established in Beijing, and the graduate education of the Chinese Academy of Physics was given a new mission: to build a first-class graduate school with obvious characteristics through the coordination of science and education. In order to accomplish the new mission, the Graduate School has clarified a new positioning: 1) to implement graduate education with customized characteristics and guided by national goals, 2) to carry out completely open basic research oriented to strategic needs and scientific frontiers, 3) to implement science and education synergy to promote the ability of the basic research team of the Chinese Academy of Materials, and X. to carry out research on the development strategy of scientific and technological innovation to support the construction of national think tanks.

The Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Physics has become a training base for high-end talents by taking advantage of the advantages of the university science and engineering research platform of the Chinese Academy of Physics, relying on 16 scientific research entities, and relying on a team of tutors with the winners of the "Two Bombs and One Star Meritorious Service Medal", academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Sciences and discipline leaders as the main body. There are 355 full-time doctoral supervisors and 579 master's supervisors.

At present, the Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Materials has 8 postdoctoral mobile stations, 6 first-level discipline doctoral degree authorization points, 4 first-level discipline master's degree authorization points, and 2 second-level discipline master's degree authorization points, involving two disciplines: engineering and science. The authorized disciplines cover mathematics, physics, mechanics, mechanical engineering, optical engineering, materials science and engineering, electronic science and technology, information and communication engineering, computer science and technology, weapons science and technology, nuclear science and technology and many other fields.

In 2023, the school will recruit 190 master's students and 218 doctoral students (17 joint doctoral students), and a total of 266 graduate students will successfully graduate, including 155 doctoral graduates and 111 master's graduates. By the end of 2023, there are 1,384 full-time graduate students in our school, including 895 doctoral students and 489 master's students.

Since 1984, the Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Materials has sent nearly 2,200 master's students and more than 1,200 doctoral students to China's cutting-edge scientific and technological fields such as strategic equipment construction and high-tech equipment, providing strong talent support for the sustainable and healthy development of China's major equipment construction.
